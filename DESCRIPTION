Description: Understanding the drivers of microbial diversity is an important frontier of microbial ecology, and investigating the diversity of samples from microbial ecosystems is a common step in any microbiome analysis. `breakaway` is the premier package for statistical analysis of microbial diversity. `breakaway` implements the latest and greatest estimates of species richness, as well as the most commonly used estimates.
