We are submitting breakaway for your consideration. We have run checks locally, on win-builder, and on r-hub,
all of which pass either with no notes or with a note we believe is irrelevant to this package's fitness for CRAN.

Specifically, checks on win-builder and r-hub return a note that breakaway was previously archived on CRAN
because of failed checks -- we have corrected these issues. This note also lists "microbiome" as a 
possibly misspelled word in breakaway documentation. We believe this is in error, as breakaway is a 
package for statistical analysis of microbiome experiments.

Thank you!
