Understanding the drivers of microbial diversity is an important frontier of microbial ecology, and investigating the diversity of samples from microbial ecosystems is a common step in any microbiome analysis.

`breakaway` is the premier package for statistical analysis of microbial diversity. `breakaway` implements the latest and greatest estimates of richness, as well as the most commonly used estimates.

[`DivNet`](https://github.com/adw96/DivNet) is a package by the `breakaway` authors for estimating Shannon diversity, and other diversity indices. `breakaway` focuses on richness while `DivNet` focuses on Shannon, Simpson, and other alpha diversities as well as some beta diversity indices. Check it out!

## Installation

You can install `breakaway` from github by running:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("adw96/breakaway")
```

`breakaway` is actively maintained and continually expanding and developing its scope! Is there a method you would like to have implemented in breakaway? Submit a pull request or contact the [maintainer](http://statisticaldiversitylab.com/team/amy-willis)!

Do you have a request for us? Let us know! We want folks to use `breakaway` and are committed to making it as easy to use as possible. 

Do you have a question? Check out the above documentation list, then shoot us an email or open a [Discussion](https://github.com/adw96/breakaway/discussions). We receive a lot of emails from users, so we try to answer questions on the Wiki rather than responding to everyone individually.
